                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>Yes. All credit card information is encrypted
                    across a secure line.</p>

                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>Do I need to create an account to
                    place an order?</h2>
                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>Yes, an account is required to place an order
                    with Skyline Style.
                    With an account, you may save your billing and shipping addresses, join our mailing list, check the
                    progress of your order,
                    and build a wish list to share with friends! In addition, if there is a problem with your order, we
                    will notify you.</p>

                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>What if I need to change my order
                    after I place it?</h2>
                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>We begin working on your order as soon as you
                    place it. Unfortunately, we cannot make
                    modifications to an order once it has been placed. We may be allowed to cancel orders if they have
                    not shipped in certain circumstances.</p>

                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>How do I know if my order went
                    through?</h2>
                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>You should see an order confirmation screen,
                    and will be emailed an order number with
                    details of your order shortly after placing it.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>Why haven't I received an email
                    regarding my order?</h2>
                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'> There's typically two reasons for this: you
                    may have an out-of-date email address on file,
                    or you may have a spam filter that is filtering emails from us. Make sure your user information is
                    up to date, and consider disabling any spam filters
                    that may be preventing our mails from reaching you.</p>

                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>Can I back-order an item that is
                    sold-out?</h2>
                <p class='pb-8 text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>No. We have a high turnover of styles and
                    must create room for new items. The good news is that
                    really popular products can be reordered.</p>

                <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-LMtext1 dark:text-DMtext1'>When will I receive my order?</h2>
                <p class='text-lg text-LMtext2 dark:text-DMtext2'>All orders take 1-2 business days to process,
                    regardless of the shipping method used.
                    Please keep this in mind when selecting shipping options. Orders are shipped Monday through
                    Friday. Skyline Style may need to contact you if
                    there is an issue with your order, so please keep your account information updated! All order
                    communication is done via email, so it is important
                    that your email address be accurate and current. <br><br> Your order may be delayed because the Skyline Style
                    warehouse is closed on the following days:
